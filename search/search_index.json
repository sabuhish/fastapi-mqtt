This information is for beginners and for those who want to gain more knowledge. If you don't have any knowledge of what MQTT does, go ahead you will get much more.</p> <p><code>MQTT</code> stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. The protocol was invented by IBM to facilitate machine-to-machine communication. It works on the publish and subscribe model to ensure efficient communication across platforms, and also has a level system for message priority. Currently, this protocol is widely used for IoT and large-scale communication because of its small footprint and minimal bandwidth consumption.</p> <p>In addition, it is designed as a lightweight messaging protocol that uses publish/subscribe operations to exchange data between clients and the server. Furthermore, its small size, low power usage, minimized data packets, and ease of implementation make the protocol ideal for the machine-to-machine or Internet of Things world.</p> <p>The compact header size of MQTT and its QoS (Quality of Service) are geared toward reliable M2M communication at a fundamental level, requiring few workarounds to operate smoothly. QoS in MQTT means that each message has three levels of a check for guaranteed message delivery. The levels increase bandwidth usage as they progress, but higher QoS carries with it assurances at the highest level for critical transmissions.</p> <p>So to sum up above:</p> <ul> <li>It's a lightweight protocol. So, it's easy to implement in software and fast in data transmission.</li> <li>It's based on a messaging technique.</li> <li>Minimized data packets. Hence, low network usage.</li> <li>Low power usage. As a result, it saves the connected device's battery.</li> <li>It's real-time! That is specifically what makes it perfect for IoT applications.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mqtt/#mqtt-components","title":"MQTT Components","text":"<ul> <li><code>Broker</code>, which is the server that handles the data transmission between the clients.</li> <li>A <code>topic</code>, is the place a device wants to put or retrieve a message to/from.</li> <li>The message (<code>payload</code>), is the data that a device receives when subscribing to a topic or sends when publishing to a topic.</li> <li><code>Publish</code>, is the process a device does to send its message to the broker.</li> <li><code>Subscribe</code>, where a device does to retrieve a message from the broker.</li> </ul> <p>In MQTT a publisher publishes messages on a topic and a subscriber must subscribe to that topic to view the message.
